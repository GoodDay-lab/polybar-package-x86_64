# xpp - A C++11 RAII wrapper for XCB

## Synopsis

XPP is a C++11
[RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization)
wrapper around [X protocol C-language Binding
(XCB)](http://xcb.freedesktop.org). Pointers to dynamically allocated memory,
such as events and errors are wrapped in std::shared_ptr.

Furthermore, interfaces for connection and resource types are provided to
facilitate the creation of custom classes. For convenience, a connection class
and several basic resource type classes are readily available.

XPP makes widespread use of the
[Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP)](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C++_Idioms/Curiously_Recurring_Template_Pattern)
to avoid overhead through dynamic dispatch. Hence, most interfaces are
implicitly defined.

### Documentation

The bindings can be generated by calling `make` in [src/tests](src/tests).

Currently there is no documentation available. Until then please refer to the
source. A recent (and working) example can be found in
[src/tests/requests.cpp](src/tests/requests.cpp).
To compile it, call `make requests.cpp` in [src/tests](src/tests).
